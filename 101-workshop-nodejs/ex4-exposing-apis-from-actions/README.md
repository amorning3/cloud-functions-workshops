# Expose actions as APIs

This exercise shows you how to create public HTTP endpoints from IBM Cloud Functions (ICF) actions. You will learn how to create web actions and use the integrated API gateway.

Once you have completed this exercise, you will have:

* Learned how to expose your actions as HTTP endpoints.
* Created numerous examples of web actions.
* Enabled API Gateway integration, including authentication and rate-limiting.

Once this exercise is finished, you will be able to create scalable HTTP accessible APIs for actions using ICF!

## Background

Serverless applications are a great solution for building public API endpoints. Developers are now building serverless web applications by hosting their static files on a CDN and then using serverless platforms for their APIs.

OpenWhisk has a comprehensive RESTful API for the platform that allows you to invoke actions using authenticated HTTP requests. However, if you want to build APIs for public web sites or mobile applications, the authentication credentials will need embedding in client-side files. This is a terrible idea for obvious reasons, but don't panic!

ICF has a solution for creating public APIs to invoke your actions without exposing credentials.

First, let's review some concepts which explain how this feature works in Apache OpenWhisk.
